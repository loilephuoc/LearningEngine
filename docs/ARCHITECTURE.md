# Architecture

## Build modules

The Gradle build has two modules:

1. Root project
   - Domain model and domain services
   - Application use cases and ports
   - Infrastructure and persistence adapters
   - JVM adapters and command-line entry points
   - Automated tests

2. `desktop`
   - Compose Desktop application
   - Depends on the root project
   - Owns presentation state, screens, components, and desktop wiring

## Dependency direction

```text
Desktop / JVM adapters
        ↓
Application use cases and ports
        ↓
Domain model and domain services

Infrastructure implements application ports.
```

Domain and application code must not depend on Compose Desktop or concrete JSON storage details.

## Main capability boundaries

The current source contains these broad areas:

- Content and learning-item domain
- Content packaging, package validation, import, registration, and media
- Content-library collections and package attachment
- Study sessions, item selection, sibling avoidance, and queue planning
- Review transitions, memory state, FSRS/scheduling, and due-state calculation
- Progress and review-history queries
- JSON-backed and in-memory persistence, mappers, stores, repositories, and transactions
- Dashboard, statistics, analytics, and scheduling diagnostics
- JVM/legacy import entry points
- Compose Desktop shell, dashboard, content library, study, review history, statistics, and settings

## Integration rule

A feature is complete only when all required layers are connected:

```text
Domain behavior (when needed)
→ application command/query/use case
→ infrastructure implementation and persistence
→ desktop/JVM adapter wiring
→ automated tests
→ user-visible flow
```

Do not add disconnected abstractions or placeholders solely to name a future capability.

## Persistence compatibility

Existing persisted data and package formats are product contracts. Changes must preserve compatibility or include explicit migration, validation, rollback considerations, and tests in the same batch.

## Platform strategy

The engine remains reusable and UI-independent. Compose Desktop is the active client and the first release target. Android, iOS, and Web are later consumers; their future needs must not force premature shared abstractions before Desktop Beta works end-to-end.
## Desktop Study accessibility presentation

Desktop Study derives screen-reader status and progress text through the pure `StudyAccessibilityPresentation` model. Compose semantics consume that model, keeping accessibility wording testable without UI instrumentation and aligned with the same `StudyUiState` that drives visible controls and keyboard shortcuts.


## Desktop Study action accessibility

`StudyActionAccessibility` is the single presentation boundary for Study control labels, shortcut hints, and screen-reader descriptions. `StudyScreen` applies those descriptions directly to retry, start, reveal, and rating controls while keyboard action resolution remains in `StudyKeyboardShortcut`.


## Desktop Study rating guidance

`StudyRatingGuidance` centralizes the learner-facing meaning of Again, Hard, Good, and Easy. `StudyScreen` renders the same ordered guidance beside the rating controls and exposes a combined semantic description, keeping scheduling intent, keyboard shortcuts, and screen-reader wording aligned through one pure presentation model.


## Accessible scheduler feedback

`StudySchedulerFeedbackAccessibility` converts the latest persisted scheduler decision into a concise, screen-reader-safe announcement. `StudyAccessibilityPresentation` includes that result when the next question becomes ready or the session completes, so keyboard-only and screen-reader users receive confirmation that the previous rating was saved together with its next interval and review time.


## Scheduler feedback card semantics

The visible `SchedulerFeedbackCard` uses the same `StudySchedulerFeedbackAccessibility` boundary as live announcements. Its merged semantic description exposes the rating, stage transition, interval, next-review time, difficulty and stability transitions, review count, and lapse count as one coherent screen-reader unit.


## Study content semantics

`StudyContentAccessibility` labels the active learning text as a Study prompt and exposes the translation only after answer reveal as a Study answer. This prevents unlabeled prompt/answer text from becoming ambiguous to screen-reader users while preserving the existing reveal boundary.


## Study focus transition boundary

`StudyFocusTransitionKey` converts the current Study state into a stable, testable focus identity. `StudyScreen` reacquires its keyboard focus whenever the phase, reviewed count, current item, or recoverable error changes. This keeps Enter, Space, and 1–4 shortcuts active after start, reveal, grade, retry, item advance, and completion transitions without coupling Compose focus behavior to scheduler internals.


## Session completion summary semantics

`StudySessionSummaryAccessibility` converts the completed Study state into one ordered semantic description containing the session title, total reviewed items, new/review split, optional lesson progress, and the Enter-key next action. The visible completion card merges descendants so screen readers hear a concise result instead of disconnected labels and numbers.


## Scheduler stage-transition presentation

`formatStudyStageTransition` is the presentation boundary for scheduler stage changes shown by Desktop Study. It converts enum-style stage identifiers into readable labels and inserts the Unicode transition arrow from UTF-8 source, preventing corrupted mojibake from leaking into visible and screen-reader scheduler feedback.


## Content Library empty-state presentation

`ContentLibraryEmptyPresentation` owns the first-run empty-state copy and semantic description. The empty card now includes a direct import action, so new users do not need to discover the same action in the header before they can create their first library.
