# Changelog

## Batch27 — Persisted OPD3 restart integration coverage

- Added an end-to-end integration test that imports a representative two-item OPD3 package through the composed persisted platform.
- Verified imported learning items can start a real study session and persist a review through the production transaction boundary.
- Recreated the complete platform from disk and verified the remaining queue item resumes correctly after restart.

## Batch26 — OPD3 manifest and metadata consistency validation

- Added package-level compatibility validation that decodes required `metadata.json` during bundle import.
- Rejected OPD3 bundles whose supplied metadata name, version, or format disagrees with `manifest.json`, preventing descriptor/content identity drift.
- Preserved legacy metadata files with omitted optional identity fields and case-insensitive OPD3 format compatibility.

## Batch25 — Atomic persisted study queue transaction coverage

- Added `study-queues.json` to the persisted platform transaction boundary used by review/session operations.
- Added integration coverage proving the composed persisted platform writes session, queue, memory-state, and review-event state together during a real review flow.
- Closed a restart-consistency gap where queue advancement was previously outside the JSON transaction snapshot set.

## Batch24 — Recoverable study/review data diagnostics

- Prevented Desktop study initialization, refresh, session start, reveal, and review persistence failures from terminating the UI flow.
- Preserved the last good study state while exposing contextual persisted-record diagnostics.
- Added an explicit Retry action for repairing persisted data and reloading the study path.
- Added focused tests for incompatible and generic study persistence failures.

## Batch23 — Recoverable Desktop persisted-data diagnostics

- Prevented Content Library startup and refresh failures from terminating the Desktop flow when persisted content records are incompatible.
- Added actionable Desktop messages that identify the persisted entity type and record ID while preserving the root cause detail.
- Kept the last successfully loaded Content Library state visible when a later refresh fails.
- Added retry-through-Refresh behavior for Content Library and lesson browsing loads.
- Added Desktop tests for contextual and generic persisted-data failure messages.
- Updated handoff and roadmap continuation context.

## Batch22 — Contextual incompatible persisted-record diagnostics

- Added `InvalidPersistedRecordException` with persisted entity type, record ID, and preserved root cause.
- Applied contextual mapping to content libraries, collections, contents, learning items, content packages, and package catalogs.
- Added tests for invalid enum values and prevention of nested duplicate wrapping.
- Updated handoff and roadmap continuation context.

## Batch21 — Actionable Package Import Diagnostics

- Added non-fail-fast directory import results that preserve successful package imports while reporting each incompatible or malformed candidate independently.
- Added source-specific failure diagnostics to the Desktop Content Library instead of collapsing the whole directory import into one generic exception.
- Desktop now distinguishes an empty directory, a fully failed import, and a partially successful import with skipped packages.
- Added application coverage proving that detailed directory import continues after candidate failures.

## Batch20 — persisted session recovery reconciliation

- Added an application recovery use case that reconciles the latest active session with its persisted study queue.
- Resumable sessions now return queue progress through one explicit recovery result.
- Active sessions with a missing queue are safely finalized instead of remaining permanently orphaned.
- Sessions whose queue completed before restart are finalized and their stale queue is removed.
- Desktop Study now displays actionable recovery messages and allows a clean new session after incomplete persistence is detected.
- Added recovery coverage for no-session, resumable, missing-queue, completed-queue, and clock-skew cases.

## Batch19 — active study session recovery

- Added learner-scoped lookup for the latest active study session across in-memory and store-backed repositories.
- Exposed active-session recovery through `LearningEngine`.
- Restored the persisted queue, lesson scope, title, counts, and current item when the Desktop study screen is reopened after restart.
- Added repository contract coverage for active-session selection and learner isolation.

This changelog records verified repository increments. Historical descriptions are concise because source and commits remain authoritative.

## Batch18 — repository workflow guardrails

- Normalized the Git-first repository workflow and guardrails.
- Established the clean `develop` baseline represented by commit `748b328`.
- Confirmed the batch package/apply direction used for subsequent increments.

## Batch17 — living documentation baseline

- Restored project documentation under `docs/`.
- Documented the two-module structure and layered dependency direction.
- Established `develop` as the canonical development branch.
- Documented verified apply, build, backup, and rollback expectations.

## Batch16 milestone

- Included study-queue planning, policy, persistence, diagnostics, and metrics foundations.
- Included content-library collection workflows and Desktop dialogs.
- Included dashboard visualization foundations.
- Continued migration toward Git as the source of truth.

## Discarded Batch19 package

A previously generated Batch19 archive was not accepted as a verified functional increment and did not change the repository. It must not be reused or treated as completed work. The next genuine increment remains `Batch19`, rebuilt from the current clean source baseline.

## Documentation consolidation

The source-only continuation package now keeps four canonical documents: `PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Stale external handoff ZIPs and repository-generated batch artifacts are not part of the baseline.
