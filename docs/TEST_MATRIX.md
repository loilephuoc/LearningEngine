# Test Matrix

This matrix defines the minimum verification neighborhood for common changes. Exact source
and existing tests remain authoritative. Every released batch still runs the full
`clean test` task.

## Universal batch verification

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean test
```

A batch is not promoted when any test fails. The apply script must roll back the payload.

## Study, queue, and review flow

Run or inspect tests covering:

- queue lifecycle and planning;
- lesson-scoped selection and sibling avoidance;
- reveal and grading transitions;
- scheduler integration;
- atomic persisted review transactions;
- restart, resume, lesson isolation, and completion;
- Desktop Study state, keyboard routing, focus, and presentation contracts.

Required final verification: full `clean test`.

## Scheduling and memory state

Run or inspect tests covering:

- scheduler decisions for each rating;
- decision validation;
- interval and next-review calculations;
- stage transitions and metrics;
- review-to-persistence integration.

Any change to time semantics requires deterministic clock-based tests.

## OPD3 and package import

Run or inspect tests covering:

- scanner routing;
- manifest and metadata identity validation;
- bundle/content import;
- package registration and installed-package queries;
- partial and failed import diagnostics;
- persisted import-to-review restart;
- representative real-package fixtures.

Malformed-input work must include both rejection behavior and actionable diagnostic text.

## Persistence and recovery

Run or inspect tests covering:

- record mapping round trips;
- JSON store behavior;
- repository behavior;
- transaction atomicity;
- incompatible or corrupt records;
- restart reconciliation;
- Desktop composition wiring using persisted stores.

A persisted schema change requires compatibility or migration tests in the same batch.

## Search and discovery

Minimum focused tests include:

- `SearchQueryTermsTest`;
- `SearchTextTest`;
- `SearchMatchPresentationTest`;
- `SearchQueryGuidancePresentationTest`;
- `LessonBrowserProjectionTest`;
- `ReviewHistoryProjectionTest`;
- keyboard, refinement, result-status, and empty-state contracts affected by the change.

Test matching and highlighting against the same normalization rules. Include multi-field
rows when terms may be distributed across searchable fields.

## Content Library and Lesson Browser

Run or inspect tests covering:

- library/collection/package presentation;
- attachment, detachment, rename, and delete flows;
- dialog state and confirmation boundaries;
- import outcomes and retry;
- lesson selection and Study navigation;
- keyboard navigation;
- Lesson Browser search projection.

## Dashboard, statistics, and review history

Run or inspect tests covering:

- application query/calculation correctness;
- loading, ready, failed, retry, and stale-data behavior;
- active-screen refresh routing;
- semantic summaries and empty states;
- chart/value presentation where affected.

## Desktop shell and navigation

Run or inspect tests covering:

- destination state and selected semantics;
- F-key and cyclic navigation;
- active-screen refresh;
- focus retention;
- ContentHost and LearningShell callback wiring.

## Performance and large-data work

A performance batch must include:

- a deterministic representative fixture size;
- a correctness assertion at that size;
- a measured operation boundary;
- an explicit regression threshold only when the build environment is stable enough;
- otherwise, allocation/algorithmic assertions that do not create flaky wall-clock tests.

Never use a timing-only test as the sole proof of correctness.

## Release-readiness work

Verify as applicable:

- clean build from a clean checkout;
- distributable creation;
- launch on a clean Windows user profile or equivalent isolated directory;
- data-directory creation and permissions;
- Unicode paths and filenames;
- logging and diagnostic export;
- first-run and existing-data startup;
- upgrade/restart behavior;
- smoke flow from import to persisted completion.
